# Tests in GladIA

> How to run tests

The easiest way is by doing : `cd src ; python -m pytest ./`

You can add the following flags :
- To test only the default models : `--default-models-only`
- To test only the default inputs : `--default-inputs-only`
- To run only the mandatory tests : `-m mandatory`
- To deactivate autogenerated tests : `-m not autogenerated`
- To run a specific suite of test : `-k some-pattern-to-find`

> How add tests for a new task

By default, a suite of tests will be autogenerated for your new task as long as you provide a `.task_metadata.yaml` file.\

If you need to add a custom test for your task, create a file named `test_[name_of_your_task].py` and create a test suite inheriting 
from [create_default_tests](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/blob/main/src/tests/default_tests.py#L274) and add your custom tests ([i.e](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/blob/9a012762ee2ebafcdd8f6e25b4a712f12aecade1/src/apis/text/text/next-word-prediction-models/test_next_word_prediction.py)).

> How add tests for my model

If your model is withing an already existing task you have nothing to do.\
A test suite is specific to a task and not to a model, meaning each models within a task will be tested with the same test suite.
